title: "Tif Taylor: Student of Tea"
---

I'm Tiffany Taylor, most that know me call me Tif.
Thanks for taking the time to browse my site and read a little about me.
I'm a tea enthusiast who has been heavily into tea since about 2010.
I started out like most, enjoying various bagged teas.
Over time, I discovered loose leaf tea and of course have tried every
kind I can get my hands on!

I started to take my tea enthusiasm a little more serious in 2013
when I started hosting small tea tastings at work (about 3 people),
now in 2015 I have around 15 - 20 people join these quarterly tastings
and mini-learning sessions about tea!

Over the past year I have slowly been networking to meet other people who
work in the tea industry to learn about the different roles and business
models around tea. I am ultimately interested in transitioning to the
tea industry full-time.

In early 2015, I took my interest a step further and joined
the World Tea Academy.  After six months of classes, I was
awarded Certified Tea Specialist In September.  I plan to take
another 6 month course around health education related to tea in 2016.
